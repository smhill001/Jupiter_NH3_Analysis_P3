OPAL Jupiter Maps READ ME file

Cycle 31 Jupiter data were acquired with WFC3/UVIS between November 19, 2024 19:24UT and November 20, 2024 14:48UT.

Images were navigated using an ellipsoid limb fitting technique with equatorial and polar radii of 71492 and 66854 km, respectively.  The FQ889N data were fringe corrected post-pipeline, resulting in an ~2% correction. Each map was generated at the sub-earth longitude at 10 pixels/deg resolution, between 0 and +90 deg planetographic latitude.  Maps were mosaicked to cover 360 deg of longitude (left edge = 0 System III W. longitude, decreasing to the right) and seams between maps were interpolated to smooth, where needed.  The table below lists the Minnaert correction (ratio of cosines of incidence and emission angles to the k power) applied to remove limb darkening for each map.  The mosaics are available in TIF (arbitrarily scaled) and FITS.  The FITS values can be converted to I/F by multiplying by the values in the table below.

Map Artifacts: The FQ889N retains slight residual fringes after post-processing. The F547M filter was only obtained in Rotation 1 and was saturated, and not mapped. F343N is only in Rotation 2.

Rotation 1 (Nov. 19 19:24:48 to Nov. 20 03:41:22)
Rotation 2 (Nov. 20 06:21:29 to 14:43:21)
