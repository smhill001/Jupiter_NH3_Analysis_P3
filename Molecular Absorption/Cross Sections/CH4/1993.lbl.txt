Following table is similar to Table VIII of this paper,                       
but with one more decimal and the original spectral                           
resolution (shown in Fig. 3). The full disk albedo is the I/F averaged        
over the planet's disk at some specific phase angle, while the geometric      
albedo is the full disk albedo at zero phase angle.  The indirect             
determination of methane absorption coefficients is described by
