aareadme_L2.txt

This directory contains Level-2 FITS data files of two types: methane 
transmission and ammonia transmission. They are derived from measurements
of methane and ammonia absorption using in-band observations compared to 
adjacent continuum measurements. The FITS files represent mapped data in
system 3 longitude and planetographic latitude. Sampling is 1 deg long x 1 deg
latitude cells with the full array size being 360x180 cells

The file naming convention is: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM_S-Jupiter_PARAME.fits,
where:
    - YYYY is the four digit year
    - MM is the month
    - DD is the day of the month
    - HH is the hour of the day
    - MM is the minutes
    - S is tenth's of a minute, e.g. 1 = 6 seconds 
    - "Jupiter" is a fixed string indicating the planet, since this work could in
      theory be applied to Saturn, or even Uranus and Neptune.
    - PARAME can  take the value of "L2TCH4", "L2TNH3", or "L2CLSL" with L2 
      indicating that this is a Level 2 product and the following characters
      indicating:
          - TCH4 = CH4 Transmission
          - TNH3 = NH3 Transmission
          - CLSL = Color Slope from 632 nm to 656 nm

Examples:
    - 2022-07-30-0729_8-Jupiter_L2TCH4.fits
    - 2022-07-30-0729_8-Jupiter_L2TNH3.fits
    - 2022-07-30-0729_8-Jupiter_L2CLSL.fits

revised, and analyzed. Therefore, they are provided without warrantee as to
