aareadme_L3.txt

This directory contains Level-3 FITS data files of two types: ammonia
abundnace and effective cloud-top pressure. They are derived from measurements
of methane and ammonia transmission using in-band observations compared to 
adjacent continuum measurements. The FITS files represent mapped data in
system 3 longitude and planetographic latitude. Sampling is 1 deg long x 1 deg
latitude cells with the full array size being 360x180 cells. In addition,
'browse' images in PNG format are provided for convenience.

The file naming convention is: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM_S-Jupiter_PARAME_SX.fits,
where:
    - YYYY is the four digit year
    - MM is the month
    - DD is the day of the month
    - HH is the hour of the day
    - MM is the minutes
    - S is tenth's of a minute, e.g. 1 = 6 seconds 
    - "Jupiter" is a fixed string indicating the planet, since this work could in
      theory be applied to Saturn, or even Uranus and Neptune.
    - PARAME can either take the value of "L3PCld" or "L3fNH3", with L3 
      indicating that this is a Level 3 product and the following characters
      indicating:
          - PCld = effective cloud-top pressure of a hypothetical reflecting
                   layer
          - fNH3 = the column averaged abunance of NH3 in ppm
    - SX represents a smoothing boolean where SM indicates smoothing of the
      input transmission data has been done and S0 indicates smoothing
      has not been done.

    - 2022-07-30-0729_8-Jupiter_L3fNH3_S0.fits
